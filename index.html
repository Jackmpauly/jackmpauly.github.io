            <h2>About!</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a Senior Computer Science Major at Chapman University. I'm interested in software development and front-end design/development.</p>
            <p>
                Outside of programming, music plays a huge part of my life.
                I spend a lot of my free time listening, discovering, talking about, and writing about music.
                You can find a lot of my ramblings on my <a class='inline' href='./blog/index.html'>blog</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also a Education Director for <a class='inline' href='https://chapmanradio.live/' target='_blank'>Chapman Radio</a>, 
                Chapman University's student-run online radio station. In addition to being a staff member for the organization, 
                I also produce and host my own radio show on the site, titled
                <a class='inline' href='https://chapmanradio.live/show/paulys-pocket/' target='_blank'>Pauly's Pocket</a>, 
                a project I am incredibly fond of.
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy graphic design and digital media creation with tools like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, 
                two tools I use to produce my radio show.
            </p>
