<h3 id="sept-12-2022">Sept 12, 2022</h3>
<p>Logic is a Maryland-based hip-hop artist who unfortunately fails to apply himself in his art.</p>
<p>To preface, I do not want to come off as some uninformed listener. I have listened to all four of his mixtapes, <em>Under Pressure</em>, <em>TITS</em>, <em>No Pressure</em>, his recent album, and a bunch of miscellaneous songs here and there from <em>Bobby Tarantino</em> to <em>COADM</em>. I would say I have a fairly accurate image of his music, especially his early work.</p>
<p>A lot of the issues with Logic’s music stem from the fact that he is a hip-hop superfan first and a rapper second. I want to make it clear that this shouldn’t be a problem; as an artist, you are allowed to like other artists of your genre. I feel Logic takes it too far however, to the point where it permeates nearly everything he does. As a result, his message and art come across as obsessive, diluted, off-putting, and at times, cringy.</p>
<p>He is like what would happen if an r/hiphopheads user became a rapper. In fact, he IS what happened when an r/hiphopheads user became a rapper, he literally says this in one of the new songs off of his second (?) comeback album <em>Vinyl Days</em></p>
<p>Hip-Hop permeating every part of his art makes it exhausting to listen to and take seriously. In too many of his songs, he is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapping about hip-hop artists he’s a fan of (ie: Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Wu Tang Clan, Kanye)</li>
<li>Over beats that sound like songs from hip-hop artists he’s a fan of <ul>
<li><em>Intro</em> (2014) uses the same sample Kanye West&#39;s <em>Bound 2</em> (2013)</li>
<li><em>Metropolis</em> (2013) uses the same drum sample and almost identical drum pattern to Kendrick’s <em>Sing About Me</em> (2012), I could go on forever</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All while borrowing bars, sampling, and referencing hip-hop artists he’s a fan of (Drake, Kanye, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If all you sound like <strong>is</strong> your contemporaries and all you rap about <strong>are</strong> your contemporaries, it’s hard not to come across as derivative.</p>
<p>Again, I want to reiterate, it’s perfectly fine to be a fan of the artists that make similar music to you. Take Jack Antonoff&#39;s indie-pop solo project, Bleachers. Antonoff might be the biggest Bruce Springsteen <em>stan</em> in the universe, but he doesn’t sing about how much he loves Bruce or constantly borrow sonics from Bruces music.</p>
<p>When Logic’s not re-hashing the genre of hip-hop in the most fanboy predictable way, he’s either rapping about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being biracial. I&#39;m not gonna comment about this, it&#39;s been run into the ground at this point.</li>
<li>Or &quot;the haters&quot; and people shitting on his music. A topic that opens the door for some of the worst, whiny, cringe-worthy, bars. What’s hilarious is that this creates this feedback loop where bad, uninspired music —&gt; people hating on his music —&gt; him getting mad at the haters —&gt; writing more bad, uninspired bars.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s crazy is how much potential he has. <em>No Pressure</em> is a glimpse of what could’ve been with Logic. With No. ID giving him beats means that Logic can’t just remake his favorite beats for his songs. Being on the edge of retirement means that he can worry less about the people that don’t like his music. He is still biracial so that doesn’t change. <em>No Pressure</em> is still derivative, he still re-uses Kanye and Drake lines, but by restricting his bad habits, his artistry is really able to shine.</p>
<p>Despite these harsh criticisms, I really do want Logic to succeed. I’m rooting for Logic, but as it stands right now, his obsession is holding himself and his art back.</p>
