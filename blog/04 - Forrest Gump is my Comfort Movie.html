<p>I&#39;ll admit it: I&#39;m not really a movie guy. I&#39;ve tried many times and I know there is an entire backlog of movies my friends, my dad, and my conscious tells me I <strong>need</strong> to watch, but I&#39;ve never been able to really crack down that list. To be clear, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m unable to enjoy movies or too stubborn to pick up on complex themes and messages or too basic to appreciate good cinematography when I see it; I simply don&#39;t have the ability or patience to burn through movies (by myself) like my friends in film school do. I think part of it stems from my attention deficit disorder; unless I&#39;m doing something else on the side, it&#39;s hard for me to force myself to focus on a movie by myself for an hour and a half.</p>
<h4 id="thematically">Thematically...</h4>
<p>So <em>how on Earth</em> did my favorite movie of all time end up being a two and a half hour, critically polarizing, scatterbrained monster of a film?</p>
<p><em>Forrest Gump</em> is a movie that can be pieced together in many different levels, all of which are valid, and all of which consist of the same parts. I think this is why so many people are critical of the film while others enjoy it so much. It&#39;s these levels that have allowed me to come back to this movie again and again and never get tired of it.</p>
<p>To some, the movie is a mindless romp following an idiot protagonist who stumbles through major historical events. While I think this is an oversimplification of the story, it&#39;s not like this interpretation is without merit. At its most basic level, the story follows Forrest, a below-average IQ man, and places him in the middle of history. He plays ping-pong in China, he accidentally influences John Lennon&#39;s <em>Imagine</em>, he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal. A lot of people take issue with how Forrest doesn&#39;t will himself into these situations and how his presence throughout history is explained via sheer coincidence and played for laughs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to stop you from going through this movie with this outlook, but it doesn&#39;t do the film justice. <em>Forrest Gump</em> is a movie about life, it&#39;s about fate versus freewill, and it&#39;s about heart.</p>
<p>The feather floating on the wind that bookends the film symbolizes the unexplained randomness and turbulence of life. That randomness seemingly manifests itself in Forrest&#39;s life through the history that actively takes place around him. As well as being a source for humor, Forrest&#39;s life is a colorful, mercurial backdrop used to analyze how he and the film&#39;s characters interact with life. The character of Forrest himself acts as our control variable, in which we can compare how other characters react to life as opposed to him. Forrest is not an intelligent character but what makes him a reliable control and a good protagonist is his unwaveringly pure heart. The story is moved along by the randomness of the Forrest&#39;s life and the goodness of his heart.</p>
<p>The film is at its best when we are able to observe various characters and how they respond to the world around them. Lieutenant Dan Taylor is so fixated on his belief that it is his destiny to die in combat. When that fate is taken away from him, he  grapples with his own existence and his new handicapped state, cursing God for the hand he&#39;s been dealt. In the end, Dan detaches himself from fate and lives a life guided by himself.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#39;ve seen a lot of people criticize this film for being apolitical and conservative-coded. While I can somewhat see the angle they used to reach that conclusion, I think this interpretation distracts from the film&#39;s themes of life and is only reached through confirmation bias and actively seeking it. Sure, if you take the movie apart piece by piece, you can say &quot;this movie is about a white idiot hick who lives a conservative lifestyle and follows his country&#39;s orders, does nothing and becomes rich anyway&quot;, but I find that to be a gross misread of what the film is actually trying to say.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Forrest&#39;s heart is what guides him. He does not allow his life to be bound by predetermination or fate, even if it is by ignorance. He&#39;s not a character with giant ambitions or a real plan, he simply does what he feels is right when faced with decision or adversity and this is what enjoy about the film and his character.</p>
<p>It&#39;s so easy to get caught up in the future and morality. The truth is: we can only do so much to control what happens around us. It&#39;s good to be mindful of life, but it&#39;s just as important to take life as it comes, act well, be kind. That&#39;s what I take away from this film</p>
<h4 id="why-i-also-love-this-film">Why I also love this film</h4>
<p>Okay, this is where my &quot;not a film student&quot; is going to show, so don&#39;t crucify me.</p>
<p>Forrest Gump is funny, there&#39;s not much else to say. The way Forrest interacts with the world around him makes me laugh, it&#39;s about as simple as that. It also helps that the writing and quotable lines in this movie are great too. There are so many scenes where I can recite exactly what a character says. I&#39;m not a screenwriter or an expert on comedy, but I&#39;ve returned to this movie so often that the writers must have been doing something right.</p>
<p>It also goes without saying, but the casting in this movie is great. Tom Hanks does a great job playing a likable, dimwitted Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan is a standout character. Jenny is... Jenny. Well done there</p>
<p>You know who else <em>kicked ass</em> during this movie? Composer Alan Silvestri with this movie&#39;s soundtrack. I don&#39;t remember the first time I watched <em>Forrest Gump</em>, but I remember when I decided it was my favorite movie. It was during the scene where Forrest as a kid sheds his leg braces and takes off running. I found myself genuinely crying. It was the first time I remember a movie making me cry tears of joy and I&#39;m convinced the soundtrack had something to do with it.</p>
