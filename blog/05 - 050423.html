<p>I absolutely love when the sky looks like this. My favorite sky, period. No doubt about it.</p>

<p>My biggest fear, even as a kid, has always been the existential fear of time. I vividly remember being 8 years old at my Ông Bà house, and spontaneously breaking down into tears at the mere thought of having to move out in 10 years. The only constant in life is change, and I’m coming up on another one of those times. I’m not ready to leave the people I’ve met this past year; they mean too much to me. I sometimes kick myself that I didn’t magically meet them sooner and get to spend even more time with them. Even if I did, the end, no, rather the <em>change</em> still comes; there is no end. All my life I’ve always been able to feel whenever I’m on a timer. No timer has ticked louder than the one ready to push me into the “adult” world, beyond school. That 8 year old was terrified at the thought of moving out. 10 years later, he did. I wish I could’ve told him that everything will be alright, that he would be better for it when all is said and done. In the same way, I know that deep down, I will be a better person after this change. Until then, all I can do is what I’ve always tried to do, my best.</p>
