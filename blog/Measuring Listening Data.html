<h3 id="sept-15-2022">Sept 15, 2022</h3>
<p>Every December 1st, music and statistics nerds like me get to celebrate Christmas a little bit early with Spotify&#39;s annual <em>Spotify Wrapped</em>. <em>Wrapped</em> is an aesthetically pleasing and highly sharable summary of your music listening habits and statistics gathered throughout the past year. It&#39;s always a fun time seeing other people&#39;s rankings, comparing them to your own, and looking back your year in music. But as I&#39;ve broadened my music catalogue and started to pay closer attention to my statistics, I realized that <em>Wrapped</em> and Spotify&#39;s profile don&#39;t necessarily do my listening summary justice.</p>
<h4 id="spotifys-listening-api">Spotify&#39;s Listening API</h4>
<p>Spotify tracks your listening <em>history</em>; once you&#39;ve <em>listened</em> to a track, that Spotify track and its data gets added to your list of plays and added to your Spotify &quot;permanent record&quot; . Spotify tracks song &quot;plays&quot; that have been played for 30 seconds or more. Each of these songs, like any database, have data associated with them. Song data contains surface level attributes like artist(s), genre (a strange topic I&#39;ll touch on later), and album, but also more hidden attributes such as tempo, loudness, valence, energy, &quot;dancability&quot;, etc. We know this because Spotify makes their <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/">API</a> public and completely free to use and develop apps for.</p>
<p>You would think that with all this careful data tracking, a user could get a very detailed picture of their listening statistics, but you&#39;d be wrong. Spotify&#39;s numbers, or at least the ones they curate to their users, are pretty shallow, only showing Top 5 artists, songs, and genres. I can excuse this in the case of <em>Wrapped</em>, since the goal is to streamline the statistics and create consise summary; it wouldn&#39;t be fun to look at, much less share, if your year-end stats were cluttered and wordy.</p>
<p>Okay, but what about Spotify&#39;s API? Can&#39;t third-party developers make apps using the API to show users a better visualization of their listening data? Again however, by fault or by design, Spotify limits the kind of statistics you can extract from a user&#39;s listening history. <strong>All</strong> apps that use the Spotify API to display statistics are limited to top tracks, artists, and (strange) genres measured over the last 30 days, 6 months, and all-time plus the user&#39;s 50 most recently played tracks. This is incredibly restrictive and leaves no room for creativity using the statistics. Any app that lets users sign in to their Spotify will inevitable just spit out the same metrics.</p>
<p>Every couple months or so, a new Spotify API app will become the &quot;hot new thing&quot;, where people will share their same measures of statistics, just in a different wrapper (ie: &quot;an AI roasting your music taste&quot;, pie charts, top tracks in the form of a reciept, etc).</p>
<p>In the case of <em>Wrapped</em> this restriction makes some sense in an attempt to streamline the statistics and create consise summary. After all, it wouldn&#39;t be fun to look at, much less share, if the statistics were cluttered and wordy.</p>
<p><em>Wrapped</em> does its job of creating a buzz around the music listening community and the various apps using Spotify&#39;s API are fun gimmicks, but to get more detailed and interesting data, you have to dig deeper.</p>
<h4 id="lastfm">Last.fm</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.last.fm/home"><em>Last.fm</em></a>, formally Scrobble.fm, is a service that makes huge improvements on the listening statistics world. It works by use of the <em>Scrobbler</em>, a tool developed by Last.fm that interfaces with your music player and <em>observes</em> your listening activity in real-time, without the use of a streaming service&#39;s API. <strong>Unlike Spotify, Last.fm doesn&#39;t look at what <em>happened</em>, it looks at <em>what&#39;s happening</em>.</strong></p>
<p>While statistics from <a href="https://www.statsforspotify.com/">apps that use Spotify&#39;s API</a> are bound by their streaming service, Last.fm builds its own independent, more accurate data set. This comes with the drawback of your listening history only starting once you set up your account and link it with your preferred streaming service.</p>
<p>The <em>Scrobbler&#39;s</em> independence from any streaming platform&#39;s API means you can attach most streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, YouTube, Soundcloud, Pandora, Bandcamp, etc.) to Last.fm and concurrently track listening data from a multitude of different sources.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t end there. The <em>Scrobbler</em> is a versitile and portable plugin that comes with its own API for developers build/attach to music players and let Last.fm users scrobble on their app. This is hugely important to me, as this year I&#39;ve really gotten into collecting and listening to <em>lossless</em> audio. My primary music player, <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/"><em>Clementine</em></a>, has a <em>Scrobbler</em> plugin, meaning any music I listen to using that player will be counted towards my scrobbles.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, what the @#&amp;$ is a &quot;scrobble&quot;? Last.fm describes it as <em>&quot;a record in our database that tells people what track you listened to and when&quot;</em>. A scrobble contains information about song title, album title, artist name, and a timestamp when you listened/scrobbed the track. Your <em>scrobbles</em> are a record of your entire listening history. For instance, if you listen to 3 tracks who&#39;s album tag is <em>&quot;The Life of Pablo&quot;</em>, you&#39;ve scrobbled <em>The Life of Pablo</em> 3 times. The same rule applies for artist and song.</p>
<p>Because your scrobbles have timestamps attached to them, you can have a lot of control over how you view your stats. You can look at custom time ranges and get extremely specific. &quot;What was my most listened to song while I was on vacation during these two weeks?&quot;. &quot;What genre of music do I tend to listen to after 9pm?&quot;.</p>
